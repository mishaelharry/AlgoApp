    Types of Algorithms
    * Simple recursive algorithms
        Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
        In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
        Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.
    * Divide and conquer algorithms (Quick & merge sort)
    * Dynamic programming algorithms
    * Greedy algorithms
    * Brute force algorithms
    * Randomized algorithms
